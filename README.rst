Keygrid
=======

Generates a grid of characters from a given key. This is an app that wraps around
``keygrid.py`` and adds a GUI using Toga.

Building and running
====================

This project requires Python 3. It is recommended to create a virtual environment
for building.:

``python -m venv venv        // setup a virtual environment``
``source venv/bin/activate   // activate the virtual environment``

This project requires `briefcase`. Install it in the virtual environment:

``pip install briefcase``

Once the virtual environment is set up, go into the `Keygrid` subdirectory and run
the app in development mode:

``briefcase dev``

To build the app, run the command:

``briefcase build android      // Builds a standalone version of the app.``
``                             // android - builds for android. Can also be``
``                             // linux, macos or ios``
``briefcase run android        // Runs the built binary.``
``briefcase package android    // Collects all dependencies for app distribution.``
