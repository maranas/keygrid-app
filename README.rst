Keygrid
=======

Generates a grid of characters from a given key. This is an app that wraps around
``keygrid.py`` and adds a GUI using Toga.

Building
========

This project requires Python 3. It is recommended to create a virtual environment
for building:

``python3 -m venv venv``

Activate the environment:

``source venv/bin/activate``

See `setup.py` for supported platforms (basically all platforms supported by Toga).
E.g. For building with iOS, run:

``python setup.py ios``
